# EDA Project of cars dataset, data source : Kaggle, Performance: 100%

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project is the clear cut aproach towards the primary step considering reshaping the raw data to the meaningful data for further analysis. 
This can be a good start for learners from industries or academia who are on the first ladder of their machine learning journey.
Prior knowledge of python is necessary.

EDA involves few steps outlined in this uploaded pdf document. 

After performing these line of operations, our data set looks fair for further analysis using machine learning models.
